AI Chatbot Web Application
Chatbot Demo <!-- Add a demo image/gif here -->

A sophisticated AI-powered chatbot web application built with Laravel (backend) and JavaScript (frontend). The chatbot integrates with external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek) to provide real-time, intelligent responses. It supports features like file uploads, message history, and fallback responses for a seamless user experience.

‚ú® Features
Real-time Chat: Instant messaging with AI-powered responses.

File Upload: Upload images and other files during conversations.

AI Integration: Connects with third-party AI services for intelligent responses.

Fallback Responses: Default responses ("Hello") in case of API failure.

Modern UI: Sleek and user-friendly chat interface.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

PHP 8.0 or higher

Composer

Node.js (for frontend dependencies)

A valid AI API key (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek)

üöÄ Installation
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
2. Install Backend Dependencies
Install PHP dependencies using Composer:


composer install
3. Install Frontend Dependencies
Install Node.js dependencies:


npm install
4. Configure Environment
Copy the .env.example file to .env and update it with your API key and other settings:


cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file:


AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
AI_API_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions
5. Generate Application Key
Generate a unique application key:


php artisan key:generate
6. Run Database Migrations (if applicable)
If your application uses a database, run the migrations:


php artisan migrate
7. Start the Application
Run the Laravel development server:


php artisan serve
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to access the application.

üí° Usage
Chatting with the Bot
Open the application in your browser.

Type your message in the chat input field and press Enter or click the Send button.

The bot will process your message and respond instantly.

File Upload
You can upload files (e.g., images) during the chat. The file will be sent to the backend for processing.

API Integration
The backend uses Guzzle to interact with the AI API.

If the API fails, the chatbot will return a fallback response ("Hello").

üìÇ Project Structure
Backend (Laravel)
app/Http/Controllers/AIChatbotController.php: Handles chatbot logic and API integration.

routes/web.php: Defines routes for the chatbot functionality.

.env: Stores environment variables, including the AI API key.

Frontend (JavaScript)
public/js/script.js: Manages frontend interactions, API calls, and chat updates.

resources/views/chat.blade.php: The main view for the chatbot interface.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
No response from the bot: Ensure the AI API key is correctly set in the .env file and the API is operational.

File upload issues: Check server configurations for file size limits and permissions.
